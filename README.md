# Twitter Simple Tracker

Specifically made for Adjoe to show my interest in their company and my capablity to make concurrent applications using goroutines. 

Just a tip for adjoe viewers, using gocron package is much better than anything I write, so I wrote a simplified version of this application in /adjoe folder that I wrote goroutines myself.

This tracker will track users and tweets activities in twitter.

It's the raw version of TwigoPanel: https://github.com/arshamalh/twigoPanel

In this project, you should build and run the backend and frontend by yourself.

To draw charts, after running the frontend, you can pass structured files made by go file.
